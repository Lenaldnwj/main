The details changes when another student from a different class is selected.
You can use these graph to better understand the trends of `grades` in a glance to easily see who are the weaker or stronger students.

== Glossary

Statistical concepts are explained with examples here:

[[percentile]]
Percentile

....
The percentile indicates that a certain percentage falls below that percentile.
For example, if you score in the 25th percentile, then 25% of test takers are below your score.
If you score in the 50th percentile, then 50% of test takers are below your score.
and if you score in the 75th percentile, then 75% of test takers are below your score.
....

[[standard-deviation]]
Standard deviation

....
Standard deviation is a number used to tell how measurements for a group are spread out from the average (mean), or expected value.
A low standard deviation means that most of the numbers are very close to the average.
A high standard deviation means that the numbers are spread out.
....

[[average]]
Average

....
Average is the sum of the numbers divided by how many numbers are being averaged.
It is also known as the arithmetic mean.
A low average implies that the class/cohort has underperformed.
A high average implies that the class/cohort has performed above expectations.
....
